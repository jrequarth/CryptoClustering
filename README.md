# CryptoClustering
Challenge 11 - unsupervised learning task

Start with market data on various coins: market_data_df
The data has percentage change at 1d, 7d, 14d, 30d, 60d, 200d, and 1 year.

Normalize with StandardScaler fit_transform function
The new dataFrame is indexed with the coin name

Find k-values and best k-value with elbow curve
Cluster with best k-value, then plot

Optimize cluster with Principal Component Analysis
Find best k-means and plot
Cluster with best k-means using PCA data, plot
Determine variance ratios
